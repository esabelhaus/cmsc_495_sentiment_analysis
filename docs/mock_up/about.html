    <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>The Sentiment Analyzer compares the text input to the AFINN list. The AFINN list is a collection of words and phrases that have been rated with integer values ranging from negative five to positive five. It can be found here: <a href="http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010">AFINN</a>.  Each word or phrase from the input that is found in the AFINN list is assigned an integer value. The Sentiment Analyzer sums the values to calculate a sentiment rating for each sentence and for the overall text.
