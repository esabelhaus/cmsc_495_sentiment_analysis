        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>The Sentiment Analyzer application compares the user’s text input to an existing list of words and phrases, which were assigned a numeric sentiment value.  If words or phrases from the input are found in the list, they receive the associated numeric value from the list.  If the words are not in the list, they do not receive a value.  All of the values for each sentence are summed to determine a sentiment value for each line.  For input of multiple lines separated by a return, the overall sentiment value is calculated by averaging the values of all words and phrases from the input that were found in the list.
        </p>
        <h3>Interpreting Results</h3>
        <p>Example 1:  "The cheers filled the room."<br>
          This text returns a numeric value of 2, which is a positive sentiment.<br><br>
          Example 2:  "Life is to be lived, not controlled; and humanity is won by continuing to play in face of certain defeat."<br>
          This text returns a numeric value of 4, which is a positive sentiment.  The value of 4 is considered more positive than the value of 2 seen in Example 1. 
          <br><br>
          Example 3:  "There was an accident last night."<br>
          This text returns a numeric value of –2, which is a negative sentiment.<br><br>
          Example 4:  "The investigators accidentally destroyed the evidence."<br>
          This text returns a numeric value of –5, which is a negative sentiment.  The value of –5 is considered more negative than the value of –2 seen in Example 3.<br><br>
          Example 5:  "The crowd accidentally applauded at the show."  <br>
          This text returns a numeric value of 0, which is considered a neutral sentiment.  <br>
